# The Genome Color Tool
### A Universal Color Tool for DesignÂ Systems

White-labeling Design Systems for multiple brands with WCAG Color Contrast is a tedious and manual task. Despite many Color Tools available, nothing quite seems to fit the bill. The Genome Color Tool helps users easily normalize multiple color systems in an organization into a single standard.

## Get Started

Open [Genome Color Space](https://www.genomecolor.space/) to view it in the browser.

## How To Use

Users enter hex codes of their brand(s), into semantically named columns. Each entry is placed in the nearest L*5 slot available per column. Genome calculates the best possible tints/shades while preserving saturation. Users can download a JSON file and use a Figma Plugin to import all colors into their working libraries.
