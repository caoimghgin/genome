# The Genome Color Tool
### A Universal Color Tool for DesignÂ Systems

White-labeling Design Systems for multiple brands with WCAG Color Contrast is a tedious and manual task. Despite many Color Tools available, nothing quite seems to fit the bill. The Genome Color Tool easily normalizes multiple color systems in an organization to a single standard.

## Get Started

Open [Genome Color Space](https://www.genomecolor.space/) to view it in the browser.

## How To Use

Users enter hex codes of their brand(s), sorted for hue, and each entry is placed in the nearest L*5 slot available per column. Genome calculates the best possible tints/shades while preserving saturation. Then, users can download a JSON file and use a Figma Plugin to import all colors into their working libraries.
